- Create GitHub and starter code (done)
- Build out code base
    - Copy code from previous project (done)
    - Add a search for the Ticker and Stock name (Have to write Python Scrapper first)
- Change previous code so that it makes more sense with the structure of this project
    - Create main driver
    - Add more calculations
      - Description
      - Dividends
      - Performance
        - Short Term
        - Long Term

- Add Python code
    - Webscrapper. How will it integrate with the C++ (Scraped)
    - Graph making. Will matplotlib work or are there better options (done)

### NEXT STEP

- Need to change C++ stock so that it accepts many more variables (Buy? Recommended? Other factors?)
- Need way to verify the entered ticker is good. Search a database that I fill?
  - Need best search for this, since the ticker names are most likely alphabetized
- If more than 1 stock is chosen, compare them. This will be harder since I have up to 3
- Ask Professor Dion on how to pass values from C++ to Python!!!!
